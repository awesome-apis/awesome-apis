Simple Analytics does not own your data. Thatâ€™s why we care a lot about the interoperability of your data. Our APIs are a good example of that.  Most analytics companies do not give you access to your raw data. We believe it should be easy for our customers to get their raw data our of our database. You should decide what you want to do with your data. Simple, clean, and friendly analytics for developers (privacy focused alternative to Google Analytics)
